Project Description: 
Happy Safe is an app that will safely store users' personal information, photos, and videos. The app will be password protected where users can use numerical, or alphabetical variations, with special characters, to password-protect the application. The app will contain folders to help the users organize their personal information, whether it’s photos or any other files. We are designing this application because the current applications, that protect users’ personal information, do not have variations of the different types of data that can be secured within the application. With Happy Safe, we will be able to create an app that can store all types of personal information in an organized manner.
